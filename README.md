# DIARY 365 for NGI Search 4th Open Call

The project is newly initiated, therefore only the proof of concept is visible here.

At the moment the repository contains:
1. link to the landing page advertising the DIARY 365 App ([https://diary365.aequa-tech.com/](https://diary365.aequa-tech.com/)); 
2. mock-up pictures showing the features of the App (how it will look on mobile);
3. code of the landing page advertising DIARY 365;
4. code of the current interactive map of DIARY 365;
5. slides showing DIARY 365’s business model.

Upon acceptance of the DIARY 365 proposal, we will start working on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to develop the App, and we will upload this repository also with the following:
* the code of the mobile app that will be created for DIARY 365;
* the NLP model for emotion detection developed by aequa-tech;
* the NLP model for automatic translation developed by aequa-tech;
* the excerpts from the digitalized diaries (within the permission of author’s rights);
* the URL to the site that presents the NGI-funded project and collects the community’s contributions that will be born around it (e.g. new partnerships with other national diaristic archives, museums, etc).
